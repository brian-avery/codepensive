<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust
your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly
to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of
humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole,
the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes
from the air upon which wings beat.</p>

This is an excerpt from "<a href="https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/barlow_0296.declaration.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">A Cyberspace Independence Declaration</a>" by John Perry Barlow, written in 1966, but still readily applicable to daily society.

There's no doubt about it, new technologies change things. Piracy has always existed in some form. In the audio world, at one point it was cassette tapes, and then it was cds, and finally it was torrents. The same was true for the video world with betmax, vhs, and torrents. As each of these technologies came out, the industries they represent would throw another fit about how much damage the creations causes and how it would drive them out of business. And yet, somehow, miraculously they still stay around.

Probably the biggest industry affected by modern technology is the library. Most of the information that was available in the library can now be found shortly beyond an individual's fingertips with quick Google search. And yet, they too, remain in business.

New technologies come out, they make things that were once hard to do easier to do. They displace things and improve the world. The individuals used to the old technologies often have a hard time breaking from what they were used to. They can see the old way, but not necessarily the path forward and what direction it will take. They try and avoid the technology, restrict it, and keep things the way they were.

You can see this not just with businesses, but with people too. The oldest generations often don't even want to touch the computer or use it as sparingly as possible. My generation grew up with the computer and can pick up new technologies pretty quickly. However, when you look at the youngest generations, the world is entirely different. Just a couple of days ago, there was an <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-10-year-old-boy-cracks-java-test-in-first-attempt-record-time-2130816" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">article</a> published about a ten year old who received his Oracle Certified Professional Certificate for Java Development. This is an exam that normally takes 3 hours for an experienced professional to complete and he finished it in 18 minutes after using the holidays to study for them. He's the first to do this, but not too unusual for his age group. Children pick up new technologies at a moments notice, the next generation takes a bit longer, and the older generations don't even want to make the adjustment.

When you look at the big businesses and the government though, it's those older generations in charge. It takes several years to gain the experience needed to work in any of the upper positions. By this time, individuals are more hesitant to make adopt new technology personally. They have most likely put a lot of work into getting where they are and changes bring in lots of unknowns that they may not want to face. Given this, is it any surprise that we consistently see new issues and laws such as SIPPA, CISPA, 1996 Telecomunications Act, Net-Neutrality popping up? What's the best way to adjust for these changes in technology and encourage innovation?
