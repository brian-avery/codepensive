On my list of things to study this year is algorithms. I'd like to cover sorting, graphs, trees, and search algorithms as well as data structures.

The algorithms I plan to cover are:

Sorting
<ul>
 	<li>Merge Sort<a href="https://www.codepensive.com/2017/10/merge-sort/"></a></li>
 	<li>Quick Sort</li>
 	<li>Bucket Sort</li>
 	<li>Randomized Quicksort</li>
 	<li>Heap Sort</li>
 	<li>Radix Sort</li>
</ul>
Graph
<ul>
 	<li>Djikstra's algorithm</li>
 	<li>Breadth First Search</li>
 	<li>Depth First Search</li>
 	<li>A*</li>
</ul>
Trees
<ul>
 	<li>Binary Trees</li>
 	<li>Tries</li>
 	<li>Red-Black Trees</li>
 	<li>Spanning Trees</li>
</ul>
Misc
<ul>
 	<li>Binary Search</li>
</ul>
We will see where it goes from there. For each of these algorithms, I'll provide sample code, a description of how the algorithm works, a discussion of the performance of the algorithm, and an example of the algorithm in Go. Stay tuned for more.
