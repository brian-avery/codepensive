While debugging an issue in Mixer, I did a deep dive through the code to figure out how everything works. You can read about my findings below.

## Monitoring K8S Configuration
Mixer keeps a go routine running to watch for configuration changes and loads them as they are detected.

When Mixer first starts up, it calls link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/server/server.go#L113[newServer] which initializes the service. As part of this, it creates a new runtime, which calls link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/runtime.go#L153[processNewConfig] for the first time. Mixer adds a link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/runtime.go#L123[watcher] which watches for changes and stores them in a channel as they occur. At a predefined interval, currently 1 second, mixer will update it's config with any new changes before calling link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/runtime.go#L150[processNewConfig] again. The meat of the logic to load adapters is located link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/config/ephemeral.go#L136[here]

By default, mixer watches k8s://, but this can be overriden with the command line flag --configStoreURL. Valid paths include k8s://path for a kubeconfig location, fs://path for a file system location, and mcps://host to connect to Galley.
```
$GOPATH/out/linux_amd64/release/mixs server --configStoreURL=fs://$(pwd)/testdata
```

## Handling Incoming Events With Adapters
Mixer uses GRPC to communicate with both Envoy and Adapaters. The adapters are defined link:https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/mixer/adapter[here] and implement templates defined link:https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/mixer/template[here]. The API for mixer itself is defined link:https://github.com/istio/api/blob/master/mixer/v1/service.proto[here]. Envoy communicates with Mixer using the client defined link:https://github.com/istio/proxy/blob/master/src/istio/mixerclient/client_impl.cc[here].

Events come to the link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/dispatcher/dispatcher.go#L119[check] implementation of the link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/dispatcher/dispatcher.go#L36[dispatcher] interface. From here we go to link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/mixer/pkg/runtime/dispatcher/session.go#L105[dispatch], which finds destinations (adapters), and forwards requests off to the destinations matching the namespace and type in link:parallel. If no adapters are found, check returns a default value.

* Dynamic instances are determined by having a predefined template type. If the type is not predefined, then it's dynamic and not static.
